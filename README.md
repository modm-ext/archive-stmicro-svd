# SVD Archive for STMicroelectronics

This repository archives the CMSIS-SVD files extracted from the technical
documentation, CMSIS header files, and provided by STMicroelectronics.

This repository contains only SVDs.
The generation code is part of the `modm-io/modm-data` repository, which also
runs it as part of its CI pipeline. Please open any issues there.
